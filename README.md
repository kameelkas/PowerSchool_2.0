# PowerSchool_2.0
Computing Science 30 Final Project. An initial version of a new and improved software focusing on convenience, functionality, and ease of use for teachers and students alike. The 'PowerSchool2.0'. Completed with @harshp30


## Date Completed: 
June 2021

## Description
This final project was a way for my partner and I to showcase the skills we had learned at the time in terms of the basics of Python and how
to code in an object-oriented fashion. The main features of our program included a login system for teachers and students, a comprehensive grade viewer and breakdown on both the teacher and student side, a class scheduling system, the ability for a student to set academic goals for a class, adding and 
removing classes (teachers), and a proper weightage system for grades. Some ideas we thought of at the time to improve our final product were to create GUI functionality, use the grade information to create graphs to help teachers detect cheating, and adding an attendance system.
